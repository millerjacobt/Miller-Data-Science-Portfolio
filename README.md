### Miller-Data-Science-Portfolio

This portfolio will contain multiple end-to-end analytical projects from my Python data science class at Notre Dame. I plan to showcase my work in exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, modeling, and result reports. 

My first project is the V-Dem indices modeling tool. Navigate to the [V-Dem Visualization Tool](basic_streamlit_app/) folder to use the app!
