### Miller-Data-Science-Portfolio

This portfolio will contain multiple end-to-end analytical projects from my Python data science class at Notre Dame. I plan to showcase my work in exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, modeling, and result reports. 

I have organized this repository into folders for data, EDA, visualizations, models, and utility functions.
